## GelBox

A software written and developed in MATLAB App Designer. It is a new workflow aiming to improve rigor, reproducibility, and traceability of the gels and blots. GelBox workflow starts with the gel image and ties the raw gel image, image adjustments, data quantification, analysis export, and import together under a single tool.

It employs curve-fitting techniques to represent the density profiles using a mathematical function in the form of a summation of Gaussian functions.

GelBox saves analysis in a unique GBX format and these files can be opened. Researchers can revisit and review their analysis at any given time in the future.
