## GelBox

A program written and developed in MATLAB App Designer to analyze gels and immunoblots with overlapping bands. It employs curve fitting techniques to represent the densitometry profiles using a mathematical function in the form of a summation of Gaussian functions.
GelBox can analyze up to 3 bands simultaneously, providing users with an automated display. It also allows future users to create their custom workflows due to its modular architecture.
