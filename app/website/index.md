## GelBox 3

A program written and developed in MATLAB App designer to analyze gels and immunoblots with overlapping bands. It employes curve fitting techniques to represent the densitometry profiles using a mathematical function in the form of summation of Gaussian functions.
GelBox 3 can analyze up to 3 bands simultaneously and provides users with automated display. It also allows future users to create their custom workflows as a result of its modular architecture.
