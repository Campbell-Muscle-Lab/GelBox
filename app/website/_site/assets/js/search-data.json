    "content": "GelBox 3 fits the summation of Gaussian functions to the densitometry profile using a workflow that is similar to GelBandFitter. Such mathematical function is defined as follows: . where x is the position along the height of the region of interest (ROI), n is the number of bands, Ai and xi are the peak amplitude and its location, respectively, α determines the curvature, and ϕ is the skewness parameter. Each parameter alters the shape of the function. While the peak amplitude sets the maximum value, its location shifts the curve along the x direction (Panel A and B in below figure). As the α parameter increases, the width of the curve decreases (Panel C in below figure). A non-zero skewness parameter allows the function to be asymmetric (Panel D in below figure). GelBox 3 assigns identical shape and skewness parameters to functions assuming the proteins run in similar shapes. This assumption can be overwritten through adjustable starting parameter estimates. GelBox 3 adjusts the parameters for each Gaussian function until the minimum residual sum of squares of the density profile and fitted function is obtained. Such objective function is defined as follows: . where k is the number of pixels in the ROI, D(x) is the densitometry profile, S(x) is the fitted function at the end of each iteration, and P is the penalty. A penalty condition is applied to prevent the following occurrences: negative parameter value, negative area, negative function value, and peak location having a value beyond the ROI. Each Gaussian function is then numerically integrated to find the areas. Generalized relative band content expresiion is given as follows: . ",

After a few seconds, you should see a program window. Here is the GelBox 3 interface (Clicking on any of the images on this page will open a larger version in a new browswer window.). The interface is divided into three different panels. Their functionality is summarized as follows: . | Gel Image: The image axes to display the gel images. The main region of interest (ROI) box controls are located above the axes. Users can create and delete ROI boxes. | Optical Densities: It shows the raw and background corrected densitometry profiles within the ROI. Box Zoom axes shows an enlarged version of the enclosed area for a closer review. | Fitting: It shows the results of the curve fitting process. The main fitting controls are located in this panel. | . The first step of the analysis with GelBox 3 is to load an image file to the environment. The File button on the top menu opens a dropdown menu, shown in rectangle. The first option of the dropdown is the Load Image. Upon clicking the Load Image button, it opens a normal Windows File Open Dialog. Locate the folder, which has the gel images, on your computer. GelBox can work with PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and TIFF or TIF (Tag Image File Format) files. In this tutorial, the file format is selected as TIF in the red rectangle. This can be switched to PNG using the file extension dropdown. Select your gel image and click Open. An image of your gel should now be displayed in the gel image panel (red rectangle). GelBox can work with both fluorescent and non-fluorescent images. In the case of a fluorescent image, click the File button in the toolbar and click the Invert Image button (red rectangle). Clicking Invert Image button transforms bright pixels to dark pixels and vice versa. The inverted image appears in Gel Image panel. GelBox 3 stores various information of the loaded image file. To access the image file information click the Data Analysis button on the toolbar, shown in red rectangle. Click the Gel Image File Information and open to open the below window. In this tutorial, the loaded gel image is a titin gel. We are interested in quantifying the relative quantities of cardiac N2B and N2BA titin isoforms. The first lane of the gel is loaded with a skeletal control sample. Zoom into the lane of interest by changing the mouse cursor mode to MATLAB’s zoom-in feature. This feature appears on the top right corner of the image axes. It is hidden, but as you hover over the image, it appears (shown in red rectangle). Zoomed-in image shows the second, third, and the fourth lane of the gel. You can now zoom into the lane of interest by using the scroll wheel of the mouse or changing the mouse cursor mode to MATLAB’s zoom in feature. This feature appears on the top right corner of the image axes. It is hidden, but as you hover over the image, it appears. The next step is to draw ROI box for analysis. Box controls are placed above the image axes, shown in red rectangle. After clicking the New Box button, the mouse cursor changes into a crosshair. Click on the image and expand the ROI to a desired size. The newly generated box appears light green. The GelBox 3 automatically processes the enclosed area in the ROI. Please note that all the empty axes and fields are populated now. | Optical Densities: In this panel, the contents of the ROI is displayed in the Box Zoom axes. Please note that the Boz Zoom image can be seem to be darker than the original. It is because of the “scaled image display” option by MATLAB, in which the pixel intensities are scaled with respect to maximum available pixel intensity. This is used for display purposes, and it does not impact the calculation. The raw and background corrected optical densities are shown in solid black and dashed black lines, respectively. The baseline is shown in dashed magenta line. Background corrected densitometry is obtained by subtracting baseline from the raw density. Three different area values are automatically calculated. | Total Area: The area under the raw densitometry profile | Background Area: The area under the baseline | Background Corr. Area: The area under the background corrected densitometry profile | . | Fitting: In this panel, the fitted function is displayed in dashed green line. The red shaded area in the Background Corrected Optical Density axes shows the area under the Gaussian function. The R-squared value is employed as a goodness of fit measure. Band Relative Area 1 is greyed out since the number of bands is selected as one. Since there are two bands in the ROI, click the Number of Bands dropdown, shown in red rectangle, and change it to two. The fitting results are updated and relative area values are calculated. | Band Area 1 (Red): The area under the Gaussian function highlighted in red | Band Area 2 (Blue): The area under the Gaussian function highlighted in blue | Band Relative Area 1 (Red): The relative area of Area 1, calculated as Rel. Area 1 = Area 1/(Area 1 + Area 2) | Band Relative Area 2 (Blue): The relative area of Area 2, calculated as Rel. Area 2 = Area 2/(Area 1 + Area 2) | . | . The box can be resized and dragged along the image. The fitting process automatically follows the position of the box. You can explore a better fit by replacing or resizing the box. The fitting parameters are initialized by GelBox 3 and can be edited using the Fitting Parameters button (red rectangle) in the Fitting Panel. Click the Fitting Parameters button and it opens a new window. The window shows the tabulated estimated (beginning of the fitting) and calculated (end of the fitting) parameter values. The Starting Parameter Estimates table is editable, except the Band No column. Let’s change the shape paameter value of the band two from 0.0059 to 0.0050, then click the Update Starting Parameter Estimates button, shown in red rectangle. This button starts over the fitting process with new starting parameters. Please note that the changing the shape parameter results in a slighlty better fit and the relative area values are changed by 0.02, highlighted in red rectangle below. Usually, there is more than one lane of interest in gels. Once you are completed with the current box, generate your next box as mentioned above. GelBox 3 will automatically place a new box in the vicinity of the old box. All the boxes have the same dimensions. The new box becomes the selected box (light green) and the old box is shown in red. Drag the new box to the desired position. Please note that the inset and density figures are updated as the box moves. You can change the selected box using the Box Selection dropdown, shown in rectangle. The second box can also be dragged around the image. However, when the selected box is resized, all the existing boxes change their size as well. Please note that the fits may change as a result of resizing. Make sure to check all the existing boxes to verify fits. The new box positions, sizes and area values can be accessed through the Selected Box Information window. Click the Data Analysis button on the toolbar, shown in red rectangle. Clicking the Selected Box Information button opens the following window. Once you finish your analysis, click the File button on the toolbar (red rectangle )to save your analysis and export analysis summary as an Excel file. Save Analysis button opens the following file dialog box, which allows you to save GelBox 3 analysis files in a unique .gdf format. This file format can be loaded to GelBox 3 to revisit the analysis. Name your file and click Save. Export Results button opens a file dialog box for the summary Excel file. Name your file and click Save. Summary Excel file has multiple sheets. The first sheet is the Summary sheet and here are the brief descriptions of each column. | image_file: file path of the image | band: the box number | total_area: area under the raw density trace | background_area: area under the baseline | band_area_bottom: area under the Gaussian function representing the bottom band | band_area_top: area under the Gaussian function representing the top band | band_left: position of the upper left corner on the x-axis | band_top: position of the upper left corner on the y-axis | band_width: width of the box | band_height: height of the box | fitting_mode: number of Gaussian functions | num_of_bands: number of bands | r_squared: R-Squared value of the fit | . The following sheets are named after the boxes. There is a sheet for each box in the analysis. Here are the brief descriptions of each column. | x: raw optical density value | y: pixel index along the height of the box | x_fit: fitted function value | x_back: background density value | band_1: 1st Gaussian function value | band_2: 2nd Gaussian function value | . In addition, users can generate summary plots for their analysis. Click the Data Analysis button on the toolbar. The Summary Plot button is located at the bottom of the dropdown, shown in red rectangle. It opens a dialog box. The dialog box asks users to select the output folder, name the figure file, and define the band labels. Fill the fields with information and then click the Generate Summary Plots button . After a couple of seconds, the following figure appears and is saved under the selected folder. ",

Here’s an example of a situation that you might encounter with your own gels. Please note that the fitted function does not properly represent the density profile. The application only captures one peak and as a result there is only one non-zero Gaussian function. The problem here is that the software hasn’t managed to find a good fit. There are two distinct possibilities. | There is not a good mathematical fit to the experimentally-measured profile, and | There is a good fit and GelBox 3 could not find it | . It is not always easy to identify the situation. One possible first step is to visualize the fitting process to observe how the function develops through iterations. Draw Fitting checkbox, shown in red rectangle, lets users to visualize fitting. As soon as the box is checked, fitting starts over. Please note that this might take a little bit longer as each fitting iteration is simultenously plotted. draw_fitting.mp4 . The first couple iterations show that the peak locations are not accurately predicted by the application. Click the Fitting Parameters in the Fitting panel for the starting parameter estimates. Although the peak locations are roughly around 20 and 60 for band 1 and band 2, the estimated parameters are 100 and 80, respectively. Change the peak locations for both band 1 and band 2 and click the Update Fitting Parameters button. Please note that the upon changing the peak locations, GelBox 3 succesfully detected the two peaks. You can look for better fits by changing the size and position the region of interest (ROI) box. Further improvement can be made by changing the shape parameter of the second band using the Fitting Parameters. Through these troubleshooting steps, an acceptable R-squared value is obtained for the fitted function. In addition, both bands are represented with non-zero Gaussian functions. ",
